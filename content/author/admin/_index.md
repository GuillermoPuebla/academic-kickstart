I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh working with
[Alex Doumas](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/leonidas-doumas) and [Andrea Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/aemn1011/). 
I study how people and machines learn to represent relations between objects in the world. I'm particularly
interested in which classes of models can learn relational representations and what kinds of prerequisites (i.e., inductive biases or innate processing modules) allows people to achieve this feat.

Another area of interest concerns how people's causal understanding of different categories affects the way people categorize different objects.
