title = "The relational processing limits of classic and contemporary neural network models of language processing"
abstract = "The ability of neural networks to capture relational knowledge is a matter of long-standing controversy.  Recently, some researchers in the PDP side of the debate have argued that (1) classic PDP models can handle relational structure (Rogers & McClelland, 2008, 2014) and (2) the success of deep learning approaches to text processing suggests that structured representations are unnecessary to capture the gist of human language (Rabovsky et al., 2018).  In the present study we tested the Story Gestalt model (St. John, 1992), a classic PDP model of text comprehension, and a Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention model (Bahdanau et al., 2015), a contemporary deep learning  architecture  for  text  processing.   Both  models  were  trained  to  answer  questions  about stories based on the thematic roles that several concepts played on the stories.  In three critical test we varied the statistical structure of new stories while keeping their relational structure constant with respect to the training data.  Each model was susceptible to each statistical structure manipulation to a different degree, with their performance failing below chance at least under one manipulation.   We  argue  that  the  failures  of  both  models  are  due  to  the  fact  that  they  cannotperform dynamic binding of independent roles and fillers.  Ultimately, these results cast doubts onthe suitability of traditional neural networks models for explaining phenomena based on relational reasoning, including language processing."
